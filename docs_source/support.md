# Support

If you find you need help with any of the `json-everything` libraries you have several options:

- Join the [my Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/manateeopensource/shared_invite/enQtMzU4MjgzMjgyNzU3LWZjYzAzYzY3NjY1MjY3ODI0ZGJiZjc3Nzk1MDM5NTNlMjMyOTE0MzMxYWVjMjdiOGU1NDY5OGVhMGQ5YzY4Zjg).
- Post a question on [StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com)\*, or
- Email me at my GitHub username at yahoo.

For feature requests, bug reports, or documentation errata reports, please feel free to create an issue.

\* _If you post a question on StackOverflow, please let me know via one of the other methods.  This library collection is still rather new and SO tags haven't been created yet._
